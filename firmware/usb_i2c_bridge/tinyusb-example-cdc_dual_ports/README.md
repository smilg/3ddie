This is example code from the [TinyUSB project](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) created by hathach. It's located in [/examples/device/cdc_dual_ports](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/tree/master/examples/device/cdc_dual_ports).

It should be useful for seeing how to create our own CDC driver for communicating with Aurea.
